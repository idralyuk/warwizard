Warwizard
==========

Warwizard is a rejiggering of Dropwizard, a Java framework for developing ops-friendly, high-performance, RESTful web services. Warwizard makes Dropwizard deployable as a war file, in our case to allow it to be used on Amazon's Elastic Beanstalk.

You probably don't care about Warwizard unless you like the cut of Dropwizard's jib but need to deploy in a .war. Find out
more about Dropwizard at [dropwizard.codahale.com](http://dropwizard.codahale.com).
